Rock Image Classification Using Computer Vision

Introduction
This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a Machine Learning model to classify different types of rocks using image data. The images used in this project are primarily low-resolution, with a limited number of training samples. 
As someone who is a beginner in machine learning, this project is part of my journey toward mastering the field. My goal is to apply these skills in the future to solve real-world challenges, particularly in geology and mineral exploration, and to contribute positively to the development of these fields.

Project Overview
Dataset: The dataset consists of rock images that are primarily low-resolution. Due to the limited availability of high-quality rock images, the training dataset is relatively small.
Model: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was used for classifying the images.

Recommendations for Optimal Model Performance
Since this is a basic implementation with limited resources, there are several ways the model's performance can be improved:

Higher Resolution Images: Using higher resolution images would allow the model to capture more detailed features, leading to better classification accuracy.

Increase Training Samples: A larger dataset with more diverse samples would help the model generalize better and avoid overfitting. This could be achieved through data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, and scaling of images to artificially increase the training data.

Transfer Learning: Leveraging pre-trained models like ResNet or VGG (trained on larger datasets like ImageNet) and fine-tuning them for this task would improve the model's accuracy even with a small dataset.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of layers/filters could enhance model performance.

Advanced Architectures: Experimenting with more advanced neural network architectures, such as deeper CNNs or attention-based models, may yield better results, even with limited data.
